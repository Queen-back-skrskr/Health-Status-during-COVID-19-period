# Introduction

The Toronto Public Health released the data set of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Toronto and reported the infected cases after January 2020. 
We are aim to investigate the reported COVID-19 cases in Toronto and extract useful data to analyze the influence of COVID-19. Specifically, I 
am interested in the how the infected outcomes change in different age groups and how the effect of COVID-19 on each cases. 

We have found that the death rate of infected population is highly associated with their age and the elderly tend to have greater risk to get 
infected and lead to fatal outcome. People in a young age have low possibilities to be infected with COVID-19 and their recovery rate are higher 
than 85%. We will summarize the data, plot them in a bar chart, analyzing the data from the chart and discuss the how different ages affect 
outcomes after infection. 

Although the data has limited cases and updating weekly, we may find more accurate data of COVID-19 cases by conducting some research on the 
COVID-19 in Canada instead of Toronto in the future. 



# Weaknesses and next steps

Since the data mainly focuses on the reported cases after January 2020 and will be refreshed weekly, it could still have some infected cases 
which are not reported to the hospital. In addition, the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to catching a cold or some common lung infection. 
Thus,it is possible that people who actually infected by COVID-19 have not aware of their illness and they may not go to hospital for treatment. 
Therefore, the data of infected cases in Toronto may not accurate since there are many unreported and unknown cases. In the next step, I am look 
forward to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak in Canada instead of Toronto since this has a lager sample of infected cases and data will demonstrate 
the relationship between age and infected outcomes more precisely.
